No simple solutions for big problems, eg:
Teleportation (Build Trains lol)
One Block machine that makes a ton of power from coal (use a biodiesel farm)
Ring that makes you fly

No Mods that makes others obsolete when progressing to them (cough *mekanism* cough) 

No recipes for creative items (Seriously, whose idea was that?)

Trying to unify recipes (That may not be implemented everywhere)
